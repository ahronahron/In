# Medicine Inventory Page - Analysis & Fixes

## Database Structure Analysis

### Medicines Table Schema
Based on code analysis, the `medicines` table has the following columns:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `ndc` (NDC Code)
- `name` (Medicine Name)
- `manufacturer` (Manufacturer - nullable)
- `category` (Category - nullable)
- `dosage_form` (Dosage Form - nullable)
- `quantity` (Current Quantity)
- `reorder_level` (Minimum Required Quantity)
- `price` (Price)
- `expiration_date` (Expiration Date - nullable)
- `status` (Status: in-stock, low-stock, out-of-stock, expired)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)
- `updated_at` (Timestamp)

### Database Connection
- Database: `Inventory_system_db`
- Host: `localhost`
- Username: `root`
- Password: (empty)

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Endpoint - Missing `reorder_level` Field
**Issue:** `get_medicines.php` was not including `reorder_level` in the SELECT query, but the frontend needed it for edit functionality.

**Fix:** Updated the SELECT statement to include `reorder_level`:
```php
SELECT id, ndc, name, manufacturer, category, quantity, reorder_level, price, expiration_date, status, dosage_form
```

### 2. ✅ API Base URL - Incorrect Path
**Issue:** The `getApiBaseUrl()` function was using hardcoded paths like `/INVENTORY/In/php` which wouldn't work in all environments.

**Fix:** Changed to use relative paths:
```javascript
function getApiBaseUrl() {
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    if (currentPath.includes('/pages/')) {
        return '../php';
    }
    return 'php';
}
```

### 3. ✅ URL Parameters Not Handled
**Issue:** The page wasn't reading URL parameters like `?filter=low-stock` or `?search=term` from dashboard links.

**Fix:** Added URL parameter handling:
- `?filter=low-stock` - Sets status filter to low-stock
- `?search=term` - Pre-fills search and applies filter
- `?filter=recent` - For future use

### 4. ✅ Loading State Missing
**Issue:** No visual feedback when data is being fetched.

**Fix:** Added loading spinner that shows while fetching data.

### 5. ✅ Error Handling Improvements
**Fix:** Added better error handling with console logging for debugging and user-friendly error messages.

## Current Functionality Status

2. **Column Toggle** - Show/hide columns (currently shows alert)
3. **CSV Export** - Export to CSV (currently shows alert)
4. **Sorting** - Column sorting (UI exists but not functional)
